<p style="text-align:center"></p>Efficient inhibitory control has often been considered as a distinctive feature of humans and vertebrates with large, complex nervous systems.
However, recent work suggests that fish, despite a relatively small brain size, are capable of solving inhibition tasks and that their performance is comparable to that observed in vertebrates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>For ManyFishes Study 1, we will use a version of the detour paradigm, the cylinder task, to test inhibitory control in a variety of fish species.
Advantages of such task is that it is simple to implement, is relatively flexible, does not require any complex/expensive equipment, requires minimal exposure and training, and is easily applicable to a wide range of species/taxa and settings.</b>
ManyFishes' primary goal is to have researchers develop appropriate methods for wide application across species and settings. Importantly, these methods should be higly standardized for direct cross-species comparisons, yet suitably adapted to the species under investigation.</p>
