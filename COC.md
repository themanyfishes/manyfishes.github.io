title: ManyFishes' Code of Conduct
---
Last update: November 9, 2023

# Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as collaborators of ManyFishes pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of factors like age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, political perspective, status within the community, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

# Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Ensuring confidentiality of information generated within the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by collaborators include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Disclosing ideas and information not yet publicly available with an external entity (e.g., individual, institution) or in a public forum

# Our Responsibilities
The Project Leads, who coordinate the project (see Collaboration Agreement), are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. The Project Leads have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, emails, tweets and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any collaborator for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

# Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (e.g., OSF, Slack, Zoom, GitHub, mailing lists) and in public spaces (e.g., social media) when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event (e.g. during a conference presentation or at a meetup). Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the Project Leads.

# Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Project Leads. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated by the Project Leads, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances, ranging from discussion of these policies to expulsion from the group, including all mailing lists (either temporarily or permanently). It is at the complainant’s discretion to pursue additional action through other legal or institutional mechanisms. The Project Leads are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Project Leads who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of project’s leadership. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

# Confidentiality
Project collaborators can reasonably expect their intellectual contributions to remain confidential and will not be distributed outside of meetings or documented outside of ManyFishes resources/files. Collaborators to the project are expected to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any information discussed during private meetings or project-related materials. The project’s standards must be upheld at all times, and any action that could potentially compromise its integrity should be avoided. Collaborators are urged to prioritize the project’s success and to act accordingly by adhering to the principles of confidentiality. Any questions or comments about confidentiality and sharing should be addressed to Project Leads.
